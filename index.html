    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Heat oven to 350 degrees and line four 6-cup muffin tins with cupcake liners. Filter together flour, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder and set aside. Use standing mixer/hand-mixer to cream butter. Add sugar and vanilla and mix to combine. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each one, until they it is smooth. </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>On lowest speed, alternately add dry ingredients in 3 addition and milk in two. Beat until smooth and fully combined, but you don't want to overwork it.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into pans that should already be prepared, filling approximately two-thirds of the pan(no need to smooth the tops). Bake cupcakes for approximately 25 minutes, until the tops are puffed. Be sure not to over bake the cupcakes, but if you take them out too early, then they may sink a bit. After, cool the cupcakes in the tins for approximately five minutes and then take them out of the tins and keep them out to cool. </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p> How to make the ganache: Put all of the ingredients that are listed above(in the ganache ingredients section) into a small, deep saucepan above medium-low heat.  After, cook and make sure to whisk after every few minuted until the chocolate and the butter are almost melted. Then take the pan off of the heat and continue to whisk until all of the chocolate has melted(the ganache should be shiny and without lumps). </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>When the ganache is around room temperature, use a butter knife to spread it evenly on the cakes and sprinkle with nonpareil(optional). The cakes can be made a day before and refrigerated or frozen in an airtight container.</p>
